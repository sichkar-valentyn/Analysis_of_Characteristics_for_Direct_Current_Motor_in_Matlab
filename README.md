## Description
Simulation, analysis, and optimization of a DC motor. Matlab will be used for producing Nyquist, Bode, Step, and Impulse charts, which produce important result data such as percent overshoot and settling time.

<br/>Stability analysis – the Nyquist plot shows the following trends:
<br/>- The motor is stable for all frequencies.
<br/>- The motor is stable regardless of inertia.

<br/>Critical Frequencies Analysis – the Bode plot shows the following trends:
<br/>- Peak gain decreases as inertia increases.
<br/>- The phase margin increases as inertia increase.
<br/>- The frequency for Peak Gain shifts from 57Hz to 17.2Hz as inertia increases.
<br/>- The frequency for Phase Margin shifts from 192Hz to 67.1Hz as inertia increases.

<br/>Overshoot and Settling Time – the Step chart shows the following trends:
<br/>- The overshoot decreases by 37.7% as the inertia increases.
<br/>- The settling time is not very affected by the inertia.

<br/>Response Magnitude and Settling Time – the Impulse chart shows the following trends:
<br/>- The peak response drops from ~3000 to 789 as inertia increases.
<br/>- The settling time is not very affected by the inertia.
